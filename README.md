The documentation site lives in `docs/` and is built with Docusaurus.

```

GitHub Pages deployment is handled by `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.

## Development Workflow

## Contributing

Commits and pull requests must not carry AI-assistant attribution (no `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming
an assistant, no "Generated with [...]" line in the commit body or PR description) — the person who
ran the tool is the sole author of the work. Every author, committer and `Co-Authored-By` email is
also checked against [.github/allowed-commit-emails.txt](.github/allowed-commit-emails.txt); add a
new contributor's address there in the same pull request that first carries their commits. Both rules
are enforced in CI by the *Commit Authorship* check
([.github/workflows/commit_authorship.yml](.github/workflows/commit_authorship.yml)), which you can
also run locally:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/check-commit-authorship.sh origin/dev..HEAD
```

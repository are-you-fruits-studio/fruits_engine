//! # fruits_app_launcher
//!
//! Entry points that start a `fruits_engine` application, either with the game
//! code compiled into the same binary or loaded from a separate dynamic library.
//!
//! # How to use
//!
//! These functions are re-exported from the `fruits_engine` facade crate, so an
//! application normally reaches them as `fruits_engine::launch_app_statically`
//! and `fruits_engine::launch_app_dynamically`. The examples below use the crate's
//! own paths so they type-check on their own.
//!
//! #### Launch a self-contained game
//!
//! Use this when the game's components, systems, and resources are compiled into
//! the same executable. Pass a closure that populates the world; everything else
//! (default engine modules, the window, the main loop) is set up for you.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fruits_app_launcher::launch_app_statically;
//! use fruits_ecs::WorldBuilderMut;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     launch_app_statically(|world: WorldBuilderMut| {
//!         // Register your components, systems, and resources on `world`.
//!         let _ = world;
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Launch a game from a dynamic library
//!
//! Use this when the game is built as a separate shared library (for example, a
//! thin launcher driven by the editor). The launcher binary only starts the host;
//! the game library supplies its setup through the `fruits_entry_point!` macro.
//!
//! The launcher executable:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn main() {
//!     fruits_engine::launch_app_dynamically();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The game library exposes its world-building function to the launcher:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use fruits_engine::WorldBuilderMut;
//!
//! fn setup(world: WorldBuilderMut) {
//!     // Register your components, systems, and resources on `world`.
//! }
//!
//! fruits_engine::fruits_entry_point!(setup);
//! ```
//!
//! # How to maintain
//!
//! Both entry points follow the same three steps: build an [`App`], register the
//! engine's default modules with [`fruits_modules::add_defult_modules_to`], let the
//! game populate the world, then hand control to [`App::run`]. They differ only in
//! *how* the game populates the world.
//!
//! [`launch_app_statically`] is the simple path: the caller's closure is invoked
//! directly with a [`WorldBuilderMut`] borrowed from the in-process [`App`].
//!
//! [`launch_app_dynamically`] crosses an FFI boundary. It loads a shared library
//! named `app_lib` from the process working directory via `libloading`, resolves the
//! `fruits_entry_point` C symbol (an `unsafe extern "C-unwind" fn(AppInitCtxFfi)` that the
//! game library exports through the `fruits_entry_point!` macro), and exposes the
//! freshly built world to it. `App::ecs_mut().into_raw_parts()` yields a raw world
//! pointer plus the type registry; both are packed as raw pointers into an
//! [`AppInitCtxFfi`] and passed to the symbol, which reconstructs a safe
//! `WorldBuilderMut` on the other side and runs the game's setup. The library is
//! closed only after [`App::run`] returns, because the world holds types and
//! function pointers that live inside it for the whole run.
//!
//! Caveats for maintainers: every fallible step (loading `app_lib`, resolving the
//! symbol, closing the library) currently uses `unwrap`, so a missing or mismatched
//! library aborts the process rather than reporting an error. The default-module
//! helper name `add_defult_modules_to` carries an upstream spelling and must match
//! `fruits_modules`.
